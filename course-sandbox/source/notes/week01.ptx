        <title>How to use this guide</title>

        <p>
          This is the Math 340 Instructor Guide, organized by book chapter.
          <term>Please do not share this document with the students.</term> This is intended to help guide you in developing your lecture materials to ensure everyone is consistent with notation and course concepts when preparing for Midterms/the Final.
        </p>

        <p>
          The book organizes each chapter by: Discovery, Terminology, Concepts, Examples, and Theory.
          There are sometimes additional exercises at the end of the chapter.
          You should encourage your students to try the Discovery problems and read through the chapter up to Theory before class, and try out the exercises and discussion worksheets after class.
          In lecture, you’ll likely want to use a bit of the ideas of the discovery section to get started, then intertwine the terminology, examples, concepts, and theory through the lecture.
          Make sure to cover the learning goals and pay attention to any additional notes given in the instructor guide.
        </p>

        <p>
          This document will also be shared with the teaching assistants to help them prepare for discussion.
          There are also notes to the teaching assistants with some advice for preparing for weekly discussion.

        <title>General Information about Math 340</title>

        <p>
          Math 340 is Elementary Matrix and Linear Algebra.
          It is a linear algebra course that focuses on the computational aspects of the subject.
          We have other introductory linear algebra courses (Math 341, Math 375) which focus on developing proof-writing skills.
          Additionally, we have a combined introductory differential equations/linear algebra course (Math 320).
          Students in Math 340 are typically computer science, data science, and math majors, with some graduate-level students from other STEM fields (they typically end up auditing).
        </p>

        <p>
          Math 340 has a prerequisite of Math 222, which is Calculus 2.
          They will have seen integration techniques, basic differential equations and Taylor series.

          <title>We will still require them to prove/verify claims, but in a way that's more systematic than a theory-based course. For example, we will ask students to prove/disprove sets are subspaces, prove/disprove functions are linear transformations, and we will often require them to explain/justify their claims on exams. Lecture time should be a balance between proving theorems and applying theorems and showing examples. Often they want to see non-examples of things (ex: when defining invertible, they want to see a non-invertible matrix right away). They DO appreciate seeing proofs in lecture, as they want to understand WHY things work, and they know they’ll get additional examples in discussion.</title>

        <title><em>Instructor notes:</em> On the first day of class, you should briefly go over course policies/logistics before going into the material. I’ve made a short slide deck for you, but if you choose not to use it, here’s what to emphasize:</title>

        <p>
          -Go to Canvas, show them the syllabus and Course schedule
          <p>
            &#x26;nbsp;
          </p>
          -Show them each grade category
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>TA notes:</em> If you have discussion before the first day of lecture, you’ll only do Worksheet 1. Worksheet 1 covers the basics of linear systems without setting up the augmented matrix, and it does introduce some terminology (ex: homogeneous, consistent/inconsistent) that will be defined in lecture in future class meetings.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the first day of discussion:
        </p>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Make sure to introduce yourself and tell students what you’d like to be called (and maybe even write it out phonetically on the board).
                Tell them how to contact you and how to find your office hours.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Briefly go over the structure of discussion: Group work on worksheets, followed by a graded discussion activity at the end of discussion (either a 15-minute quiz or a 5-minute exit ticket).
                Tell them how to find the weekly discussion schedule (on Canvas).
                Tell them that the instructor will go over the course policies in lecture, and if they have questions they should post on Piazza.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Put them in groups, have them spend five minutes introducing themselves and exchanging contact information, then tell them to start the worksheets.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                If they ask you course questions, encourage them to check the syllabus and/or post them on Piazza unless you’re completely sure you know the correct answer.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Note: For the first few weeks of discussion, make sure to write your name on the board along with the discussion agenda for that day.

        <p>
          <term>Chapter 1 Terms:</term> Linear Equation, System of Linear Equations, Solution, Solution set, Consistent/Inconsistent system, parametric equation, matrix, augmented matrix, matrix entry, row, column, elementary row operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Instructor notes:</em> This book hits the ground running with solving linear systems. The goal is to get to Gaussian Elimination quickly, so it roughly defines matrices in order to get to setting up systems as matrices. It’s a good idea to reassure the students that we’ll come back to this topic rigorously soon.

            <li>
              <p>
                Know how to find a REF or the RREF form for a matrix

                Be able to find the rank of a matrix and know what it tells you about the number of solutions for the corresponding linear system

              <p>
                Know how to calculate the number of parameters for a consistent system given the rank of the augmented matrix.

              <p>
                Understand the difference between an augmented matrix and a coefficient matrix.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          <term>Chapter 2 Terms:</term> row echelon form (REF), reduced row echelon form (RREF), leading one/pivot, row reduction, row-equivalent matrices, rank, leading variables, free variables, general solution, homogeneous system, coefficient matrix, trivial/nontrivial solution, pivot
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Instructor notes:</em> The book doesn’t use the word “pivot” to describe the leading ones, but I strongly encourage you to call it that, since it’s so prevalent in other resources. Many of the discussion worksheet solutions refer to “picking up the pivots” when we do column spaces later on.
        </p>

        <p>
          They get really fixated on the size of the matrix and what it tells you about the number of solutions.
          It’s good to emphasize that the size of the matrix doesn’t necessarily tell you how many solutions there are.
          Ex: square systems don’t necessarily have a unique solution.
          Discussing the rank should be helpful for these questions.
        </p>

        <p>
          About using the word “trivial” (for homogeneous systems): it’s a necessary word, but they get really worked up about it, as some professors have said it insultingly in the past (ex: “This exercise is trivial, so I’ll let you work it out on your own”).
          Point out that you’re not saying something is easy or silly, but a defined notion.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>TA Notes:</em> If showing row operations in discussion, PLEASE write out your row operations (ex: 3r1+r2r2), and try to match notation with your instructor. We expect the students to show their work, so it’s good to model it, as well. Additionally, please avoid encouraging non-elementary row operations and/or doing parallel row operations until later. The students should understand what an elementary row operation is in order to correctly apply determinant facts and build elementary matrices.
        </p>

        <p>
          As stated in the instructor notes, students often struggle with row-reducing to REF and RREF.
          When showing them examples in discussion, make sure to explain why you’re doing each step (ex: I want a leading one, so I’m swapping rows instead of dividing out by 4 to avoid fractions).

          <term>Chapter 4 Terms:</term> (i,j)th entry of a matrix, size/dimension of a matrix, equal matrices, matrix addition, scalar multiple, linear combination, zero matrix, row vector, column vector, vector of unknowns, vector of constants, vector form, square matrix, main diagonal, transpose
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Instructor notes:</em> You should do an example of linear combination in class when teaching Chapter 4. The book doesn’t fully describe the notion of a matrix-vector product as a linear combination. I would recommend that you write this out explicitly (they have a homework problem on this).
        </p>

        <p>
          Some students have seen matrix multiplication before, but don’t assume they’ve all seen it.
          It’s important to give them both notions of matrix-vector multiplication and matrix-matrix multiplication to set up future material.
          For example, if they understand matrix-vector multiplication as a linear combination, this makes understanding the image of a matrix transformation very easy.
          If they understand matrix-matrix multiplication as repeated matrix-vector product, this makes things like diagonalization easier to understand.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>TA Notes:</em> Please note that we are teaching them two equivalent notions of matrix-vector multiplication and two equivalent notions of matrix-matrix multiplication. This is not to be “annoying”, but to help them better understand later ideas in the course (see instructor notes above).

        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Instructor Notes:</em> The book splits up Matrix inverses into two chapters: <term>Chapter 5</term> defines matrix inverses, gives the 2x2 inverse formula, and introduces properties of inverses. <term>Chapter 6</term> introduces elementary matrices and gives the algorithm for computing inverses [A:In ]->  [In:A-1].
        </p>

        <p>
          To start, it’s recommended that you give an example of a 2x2 matrix with an inverse and an example of a 2x2 matrix without an inverse.
          Connect this to the notion of inverting a nonzero number in the real numbers, but point out that there are more matrices than just the zero matrix which are noninvertible.
        </p>

        <p>
          When showing them how to use the matrix inverse to solve a linear system, show them multiplied examples with the same coefficient matrix to demonstrate that the only modification is the constant vector.
          In particular, show them the homogeneous case.
        </p>

        <p>
          When discussing the identity (AB)-1=B-1A-1, I use the analogy of putting on socks, then shoes.
          This is not commutative.
          When you want to “undo” this action, what do you do first? What do you do second?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>TA Notes:</em> Make sure to pay attention to what has been covered in lecture when going through the Chapter 5 and 6 worksheets. If the inverse algorithm hasn’t been covered yet, don’t use it in discussion.

          <em>Instructor Notes:</em> We haven’t tested on Elementary matrices in previous semesters. We will likely test on them very lightly going forward; encourage them to do their homework assignments to prepare for the exam.
        </p>

        <p>
          If they’re getting confused about the matrix inverse algorithm, you can point out that another way to view it is as solving n linear systems simultaneously (maybe write it out for a 2x2 or 3x3 case).
        </p>

        <p>
          When going through the Characterizations of Invertibility, make sure to explain the logic: If one of these facts is true, then all the others are true.
          In other words, they imply each other.
          Spend a short amount of time discussing some of the justifications (ex: Why must invertibility imply that Ax=0 has only the trivial solution?)

        <p>
          <em>Instructor Notes:</em> The book defines skew-symmetric in the exercises, but you should define it in lecture. This section should take less than 50 minutes to get through. I would recommend picking one of the special forms from <url href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jsylvest/books/DLA/section-special-forms-theory.html#proposition-special-forms-combinations">Proposition 7.5.1</url> to prove in class. On exams/quizzes, we would ask them to prove something like this for a specific size matrix (like 3x3), so I’d recommend doing the same in lecture. This will allow you to write out explicitly the form of the matrix. In discussion, they will prove that symmetric matrices are closed under addition and scalar multiplication. Note that “closed” hasn’t been defined for them yet. If you choose to use that word in lecture, make sure to tell them what it means.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>TA Notes:</em> The Chapter 7 content in lecture might be quick, but the worksheet will likely be challenging for them. For exercise 3, I’m envisioning having them prove it using coordinates instead of the A^T=A definition of symmetric matrices. The goal is to get them to practice this to set up proving/disproving sets are subspaces using their coordinates.

          <term>Warning:</term> Your students will want to use the “Criss-Cross” method of computing 3x3 determinants (formally called the Rule of Sarrus). You should tell them that while they can use it in practice, we’re using the cofactor expansion in class for many reasons: 1. It easily shows how row-operations affect determinants, and 2. This method doesn’t generalize to larger matrices. They should know how to compute determinants using cofactor expansion. They have a homework problem that forces them to write out the cofactor expansion for a 3x3 matrix.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Instructor Notes:</em> Determinants are split across three chapters: Chapter 8 motivates the idea of a determinant and teaches them how to compute the determinant via cofactor expansion. Chapter 9 discusses how row operations change the determinant. Chapter 10 gives the invertibility condition for determinants.
        </p>

        <p>
          They’ve seen cross products before in Calculus 2, so they’re familiar with the process for 3x3 matrices, but some of them don’t realize that you can pick any row/column, and that it generalizes to bigger matrices.
        </p>

        <p>
          The discovery guide in the book does a great job of slowly building up to the 3x3 determinant.
          You likely won’t have time to do this fully in lecture.
          <p>
            &#x26;nbsp;
          </p>
          Here’s a suggested approach in lecture for setting up the cofactor expansion of the determinant:
          <p>
            &#x26;nbsp;
          </p>
          1.
          Recall the 2x2 inverse formula, and what conditions need to be satisfied for this to work (maybe derive the formula if you have time)
          <p>
            &#x26;nbsp;
          </p>
          2.
          Define the 2x2 determinant
          <p>
            &#x26;nbsp;
          </p>
          3.
          Give goal: Determine a number (called the determinant) that you compute for an nxn matrix that tells you whether or not the matrix is invertible.
          <p>
            &#x26;nbsp;
          </p>
          4.
          Jump into defining the minors, then cofactors, then determinant.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some instructors introduce determinants using the geometric meaning: This probably connects with some students, but a lot of them learned cross-product at the end of Calc 2 when they were fully checked out.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>TA notes:</em> Make sure to read the warning above in case they have questions about using the criss-cross method. We may ask them to compute 4x4 determinants on quizzes/exams.

          <em>Instructor Notes:</em> I give a quick proof of many of the determinant properties: multiplying a row by a constant, det(A)=det(AT), having a row of zeros makes det(A)=0. You can likely have them participate and give you ideas on how to prove these. I show that adding a multiple to another row doesn’t change the determinant by showing it for 2x2. It’s also useful to point out at this stage that they should be careful about row operations: 3r1+r2r2 won’t change the determinant, but r1+3r2r2 will change it.

        </p>

        <p>
          A way to justify that det(A)=0 iff A is singular that doesn’t need elementary matrices: Reduce A to its reduced echelon form, B.
          If it’s the identity, then since det(I) is not zero, A’s determinant is not zero.
          If it has a row of zeros, then det(B)=0, which means A’s determinant is also zero.
        </p>

        <p>
          Again, spend some time discussing the Characterizations of invertibility with your students.
          Ask them which implications are not clear to them at this point, and spend a few minutes discussing them.
          Also play around with rephrasing the false version of these statements.
          For example, if a matrix is not invertible, why must its rank not be equal to its size?

          In past semesters, we used M_mn, so it’s on old exams.

          <em>Instructor Notes:</em> For exams and quizzes, they won’t need to memorize all 10 properties of a vector space. We’d ask them to show a specific property is true/not true. They need to know the definition of subspace (and the subspace test). If we want them to prove a vector space axiom for a given operation, we’ll give them the general axiom.
        </p>

        <p>
          The three general vector spaces we’ll be working with in this class are n-dimensional space, mxn matrices, and univariate real polynomials (all polynomials and polynomials of degree at most d).
          We don’t typically test them on the space of functions.
        </p>

        <p>
          When introducing Chapter 16, after giving the vector space axioms, it would be good to start with proving that the 2x2 matrices are closed under addition and scalar multiplication and find the zero vector to show how proving closure works.
          This also starts to generalize the notion of a “zero vector” to abstract vector spaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          You should also introduce the vector space of polynomials and of polynomials of degree at most d.
          Do not do the whole proof of Pd is a vector space in class.
          It’s SUPER boring.
          Do closure under addition (discuss why we need lower degree polynomials), and maybe the zero vector, and then ask your class one more property they’d like to see.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Chapter 16 homework has a “non-standard” vector addition/multiplication on ℝ2.
          The Chapter 16 worksheet also has a “non-standard” example (V=positive reals, x+y=xy, cx=x^c) which is also introduced in <url href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jsylvest/books/DLA/section-abstract-vec-spaces-examples.html#subsection-abstract-vec-spaces-examples-weird">Subsection 16.5.1: Verifying axioms: the space of positive numbers</url> You’re welcome to discuss this one in class if they are struggling with the notion of generalizing addition and scalar multiplication.
          If the students ask why we need to consider vector spaces other than ℝn, you can point out that other vector spaces have other operations we like to use (like polynomials and matrices).
          I also mention Tropical Geometry.

          <em>Instructor Notes:</em> They should be able to prove/disprove W is a <term>(nonempty!!)</term> subspace for V=ℝn. Emphasize that to prove something is a subspace, they can’t use numbers. When showing a set is NOT a subspace, I’m pretty picky about the use of counterexamples. They really shouldn’t use variables unless it’s obviously not closed under addition/multiplication for ANY choice of number, otherwise they won’t receive full credit.

            &#x26;nbsp;
          </p>
          Ex: The set (a,b) where a+b 0 isn’t a subspace, and if they claim that ra+rb&#x3C;0 for any negative r, I would not give full credit, since there are cases where ra+rb=0.
        </p>

        <p>
          The book doesn’t introduce the term “nullspace” until Chapter 21; it currently calls this set the “solution space of a homogeneous system.” You’re welcome to call it both at this time, but the homework/worksheets will call it solution space for now.
          I recommend you walk through the proof that the solution space of a homogeneous system is a subspace in class; it’s a good example to demonstrate that we sometimes need to rely on the known structure of matrix algebra to prove a set is a subspace instead of resorting to the coordinates.
        </p>

        <p>
          The online homework does a good job of showing them examples/nonexamples of subspaces and having them build counterexamples, but it unfortunately cannot provide feedback on their subspace proofs.

        </p>

        <p>
          They often get linearly independent and linearly dependent mixed up.
          I recommend that as soon as you give the test/definition for linear dependence (nontrivial linear combination equalling the zero vector), you also give the equivalent definition; one of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others.
          Do an example in R^3, and draw a picture in R^3 to demonstrate what happens in this case, but warn them that we cannot rely fully on pictures to understand this concept.
        </p>

        <p>
          After discussing this, then give the definitions for linear independence (only trivial linear combination, cannot write them as linear combinations) and again give them a picture in R^3 to demonstrate.
        </p>

        <p>
          When doing examples in this section, to save time, do not show the steps of row reducing the augmented matrix.
          You should show them the end matrix to demonstrate what it looks like to have linearly independent vectors (each unknown coefficient corresponds to a pivot).
        </p>

        <p>
          When working out your first example in R^3, some of them will immediately notice that it’s equivalent to think about the determinant of a matrix.
          It’s important for you to be very careful with wording here, and be picky with their wording, too.
          They’re going to try to say that that matrix is linearly dependent, which is not true.
          Impress on them the difference, and do an example with maybe 4 2x2 matrices that is relatively simple (maybe even use the “standard” matrices).
          Impress on them that it doesn’t matter if the 2x2 matrices are invertible or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          Make sure to go over the propositions in this section, even if you don’t prove them in detail (maybe do an example instead) so you can build up to basis and dimension using the previous theory.

        <p>
          Note that we avoid doing column operations.
          We tell them to find a basis for the row space by row-reducing and picking the non-zero rows.
          We tell them to find a basis for column space by row-reducing and picking the pivot columns from the original matrix.
          You could technically do column operations, but it’s unnecessary.
          The nice thing about “picking up the pivots” is that it creates a basis from the original spanning set.
        </p>

        <p>
          The book will delay calling the column space the “image space” until Chapter 42/43, since it hasn’t defined matrix transformation yet.

          Remember that we haven’t gone through linear transformations yet, so you can’t explain transition matrices as a linear transformation.
          This is good, in a sense; we really want to focus on the transition matrix as a tool to convert from one basis to another.

        <p>
          Building the matrix representation of a linear transformation is…stressful for them.
          I teach it as a 3-step process: 1.
          Apply the linear transformation to each of the basis elements 2.
          Write each image in its coordinate representation 3.
          Put the columns in a matrix, following the same order as the original basis.
        </p>

        <p>
          One way to “check” you set it up right is to apply the matrix representation to the first element in the ordered basis.
          If they do it right, it should “pick up” the coordinates of the image of that vector using the other basis.
          I have extra examples for Chapters 45 and 46 in the Folder in Drive.
          Feel free to share those with them directly (just upload to your Canvas course), or go through them in class if you have extra time.
          They surprisingly really like the commutative diagrams.
        </p>

        <p>
          A really good example to do right away is T:P_2\to P_1 by T(p)=p’.
          Do it once with the “standard” bases for P_2 and P_1, then switch to a nonstandard basis for each: B=(x^2+1,4, x+2) and D=(1,x), then use each to compute T(p) for a specific polynomial p.
          Remind them they have to “put it back” into a polynomial to finish the computation.
          You can also use either of them to compute the kernel of T.

          The book doesn’t state the Similarity Theorem explicitly, but you should.
          With the Similarity theorem, it’s helpful to show the result using both change matrices instead of the inverse of the change matrix:

        <p>
          At that moment, they do get more confused, but here’s the analogy I use: suppose a student in a Spanish course is given an essay assignment, with a prompt in Spanish (B).
          If the student wants to write the essay in English (D), what do they do?

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Take the Spanish prompt (which is our input vector), and translate the prompt to English (that’s multiplying by PDB).

            <li>
              <p>
                Write the whole essay in English (that’s multiplying by MD(T))

            <li>
              <p>

        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, that’s a terrible idea in reality, both for integrity reasons AND because Spanish/English doesn’t translate perfectly, BUT mathematically it does work perfectly :)

        <p>
          If you’re teaching Tuesday/Thursday, you will only meet this week on Tuesday.
          You can really stretch out Chapter 36 and give them time to try out verifying inner product properties in lecture.
          If you’re teaching Monday/Wednesday, it’s likely that very few students will show up on Wednesday.
          I suggest trying to cover the important concepts/examples on Monday, and use Wednesday either for additional examples or teach them something you find interesting (like Page Rank, Markov chains, etc).
          You can NOT cancel Wednesday class (sorry).

          You should start with a brief review of dot product, then again discuss with them the notion of “abstractifying” the ideas of length, distance, orthogonality, etc to different vector spaces.
          <p>
            &#x26;nbsp;
          </p>
          Note that this book does not list “&#x3C;v,v>=0 iff v=0” as one of the required inner product axioms..
          They should be able to verify a function is/is not an inner product, though we’ll give them a specific property to prove/disprove.
          You should plan to go over the inner product &#x3C;p,q>=01p(x)q(x)dx (for polynomials) with them in class, and practice computing length and distance.
          They will try to use the dot product for everything.
        </p>

        <p>
          There should be room in the schedule to discuss additional inner products, such as &#x3C;A,B>=tr(ABT) for matrices, evaluation of polynomials, and defining an inner product in terms of a positive definite matrix.

          Note: They should be prepared to check orthogonality for non-standard inner products.
          They should be able to use an inner product to find coefficients, and be able to build an orthonormal basis from an orthogonal basis.
          Gram-Schmidt is on the homework, but not on the final, so I’d go over it quickly in class (note: our book doesn’t do projections until later).
        </p>

        <p>
          We do often ask them to find a basis for an orthogonal complement on the final; you don’t need to get too fancy with this in class, just teach it as solving a system of (homogeneous) equations.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the Chapter 14 worksheet, they worked through a problem to discover that the coefficients of a linear combination of an orthonormal basis come from the inner product.
          You can use that example in class.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>TA Notes:</em> Please emphasize computing inner products, length, and distance using weird inner products does NOT give the same answer as the dot product. Vectors which are orthogonal with respect to the dot product may not be orthogonal with respect to another inner product.

          <em>Instructor Notes:</em> We cover determinants using cofactor expansion. They’ve seen cross products before in Calculus 2, so they’re familiar with the process for 3x3 matrices, but some of them don’t realize that you can pick any row/column, and that it generalizes to bigger matrices. We don’t make them compute determinants for 4x4 or bigger matrices via cofactor expansion.   I give a quick proof of many of the determinant properties: multiplying a row by a constant, det(A)=det(AT), having a row of zeros makes det(A)=0. I show that adding a multiple to another row doesn’t change the determinant by showing it for 2x2. It’s also useful to point out at this stage that they should be careful about row operations: 3r1+r2r2 won’t change the determinant, but r1+3r2r2 will change it.
        </p>

        <p>
          A way to justify that det(A)=0 iff A is singular that avoids elementary matrices: Reduce A to its reduced echelon form, B.
          If it’s the identity, then since det(I) is not zero, A’s determinant is not zero.
          If it has a row of zeros, then det(B)=0, which means A’s determinant is also zero.
          We skip Cramer’s rule and the adjoint matrix formula for inverses.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don't need to worry about complex eigenvalues (for test/homework purposes).
          They should be aware they exist, though.
          We’re going to encourage the TAs to walk through the eigenvalue calculation process in discussion again after lecture to emphasize where the det(I-A) equation comes from.
        </p>

        <p>
          We introduce diagonalization here, but we’ll return to it in 5.5 once we have the correct terminology (linear independence and dimension).
          The homework for §3.3 is split into two parts:  Part 1 (Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors) is on Midterm 1, while Part 2 (Diagonalization) will be on Midterm 2.
          Please cover: the application of diagonalization for higher powers of A, and where P,D, P^(-1) come from (the eigenvectors/eigenvalues of A).
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>TA Notes:</em> As stated above, it would be great to go over the characteristic equation det(I-A) construction with them again in discussion before handing out the 3.3 worksheet. Your instructor may not get to diagonalization, so be aware of that if it’s on the 3.3 worksheet.

        <p>
          <em>Instructor Notes:</em> The book introduces vector spaces/subspaces using ℝn first, then does the same thing again with general vector spaces.  They haven’t had set theory, so short-hand notation (is an element of, for all) is confusing, but the book does a nice job explaining this notation in footnotes. Also, the idea of subset is confusing, so it’s helpful to point out when a set is a strict subset of ℝn.
          <p>
            &#x26;nbsp;
          </p>
          They should be able to prove/disprove W is a <term>(nonempty!!)</term> subspace for V=ℝn.
          Emphasize that to prove something is a subspace, they can’t use numbers.
          When showing a set is NOT a subspace, I’m pretty picky about the use of counterexamples.
          They really shouldn’t use variables unless it’s obviously not closed under addition/multiplication for ANY choice of number, otherwise they won’t receive full credit.
          <p>
            &#x26;nbsp;
          </p>
          Ex: The set (a,b) where a+b 0 isn’t a subspace, and if they claim that ra+rb&#x3C;0 for any negative r, I would not give full credit, since there are cases where ra+rb=0.
        </p>

        <p>
          When testing for linear independence, to save time, I would carefully set up the matrices to check for linear independence, but skip the row reductions.
          Note that we skip §5.3 for now (it’s on orthogonality, so we cover it right before Chapter 10).
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that we avoid doing column operations.
          We tell them to find a basis for the row space by row-reducing and picking the non-zero rows.
          We tell them to find a basis for column space by row-reducing and picking the pivot columns from the original matrix.
          You could technically do column operations, but it’s unnecessary.
          The nice thing about “picking up the pivots” is that it creates a basis from the original spanning set.
        </p>

        <p>
          We return to eigenvalues/eigenvectors in §5.5, and also define similarity.
          Diagonalization is now precisely given in terms of algebraic/geometric multiplicity.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>TA Notes:</em> Students often confuse similarity with row-equivalence. Please stress the following:
          <p>
            &#x26;nbsp;
          </p>
          Similar is NOT the same thing as row-equivalent.
          <p>
            &#x26;nbsp;
          </p>
          Diagonalizable is NOT the same thing as invertible.

          <em>Instructor Notes:</em> On an exam, they won’t need to memorize all 10 properties of a vector space. We’d ask them to show a specific property is true/not true. They need to know the definition of subspace (and the subspace test). If we want them to prove a vector space axiom for a given operation, we’ll give them the general axiom. If you want to teach them the “faster” subspace test (show a<term>x</term>+b<term>y</term> is in the set), that’s fine. Again, emphasize that to show a subset IS a subspace, they need to use variables (and <term>show nonempty</term>). To show a subset is NOT a subspace, they should use numbers for their counterexample.
        </p>

        <p>
          If using my notes for §6.1: Do not do the whole proof of P2 is a vector space in class.
          It’s SUPER boring.
          Do closure under addition, and maybe the zero vector, and then ask your class one more property they’d like to see.
        </p>

        <p>
          The §6.1 homework has a “non-standard” vector addition/multiplication on ℝ2.
          The §6.1 worksheet also has a “non-standard” example (V=positive reals, x+y=xy, cx=x^c).
          If the students ask why we need to consider vector spaces other than ℝn, you can point out that other vector spaces have other operations we like to use (like polynomials and matrices).
          I also mention Tropical Geometry.
        </p>

        <p>
          §6.4 can be covered quickly if you’re running out of time.
          The main goal is to explicitly summarize/state a lot of the facts about finite vector spaces we’ve been assuming.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>TA Notes:</em> Again, when doing subspaces, PLEASE emphasize that to show something IS a subspace, you need to show nonempty, and need to show closure over addition/scalar multiplication using variables. To show it’s NOT a subspace, it’s necessary to use explicit counterexamples.

        <p>
          For Midterm 2, they should be able to find a basis for the kernel/image of a matrix transformation, and find elements of the kernel for general linear transformations.

        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Instructor Notes:</em> Due to the order of this textbook, we can state the definition of isomorphism cleanly: it’s a linear transformation that is both one-to-one and onto. They should be able to justify if a linear transformation is an isomorphism. We’ll go over the coordinate representation of a vector using an ordered basis more carefully in §9.1, so feel free to go over this quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
          §7.3 leads nicely into Chapter 9, as they find the idea of finding inverses of general isomorphisms SUPER annoying, so it’s nice to be able to switch to matrices and find an inverse that way.
        </p>

        <p>
          Students should also always “declare” their isomorphism if they’re using ℝn to represent other vector spaces.
          For example, if they’re verifying that 3 polynomials in P2 are linearly independent and immediately write them as column vectors, they will not get full credit.

        <p>
          <em>Instructor Notes:</em>  Please note the notation used for coordinate vectors. We also call transition matrices “change matrices” following the book notation. They surprisingly really like the commutative diagrams. The book doesn’t show one for the Similarity Theorem, so I would give one (the one in my notes is a slight abuse of notation).
        </p>

        <p>
          Building the matrix representation of a linear transformation is…stressful for them.
          One way to “check” you set it up right is to apply the matrix representation to the first element in the ordered basis.
          If they do it right, it should “pick up” the coordinates of the image of that vector using the other basis.
          I have extra examples for 9.1 and 9.2 in the Completed Notes Folder in Drive.
          Feel free to share those with them directly (just upload to your Canvas course), or go through them in class if you have extra time.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the similarity theorem, it’s helpful to show the result using both change matrices instead of the inverse of the change matrix:
        </p>

        <p>
          MB(T)=PBDMD(T)PDB
        </p>

        <p>
          At that moment, they do get more confused, but here’s the analogy I use: suppose a student in a Spanish course is given an essay assignment, with a prompt in Spanish (B).
          If the student wants to write the essay in English (D), what do they do?
        </p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Take the Spanish prompt (which is our input vector), and translate the prompt to English (that’s multiplying by PDB).
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Write the whole essay in English (that’s multiplying by MD(T))
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Translate the essay back to Spanish (that’s multiplying by PBD)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, that’s a terrible idea in reality, both for integrity reasons AND because Spanish/English doesn’t translate perfectly, BUT mathematically it does work perfectly :)
        </p>

        <p>
          §9.3 goes really deep into the idea of block diagonal matrices.
          Given the level of this course, I think it’s better to stick with the notion of diagonalizable linear operators.
          This means we’re not really following the book in this section after Eigenvalues.
          Please check out my notes for how I guide them through this.
          Alternatively, you could also combine the end of §9.2 (characteristic equation) with the problem of finding the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of a linear operator, then finding the diagonalization.
        </p>

        <p>
          They want to know why non-standard bases would be used.
          It’s useful to point out that for a diagonal matrix representation, we can quickly deduce a lot of information about the linear operator (ex: determinant, eigenvalues, invertibility) as well as what happens when we repeatedly apply the linear operator.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>TA Notes:</em> They’re going to try to use the standard basis (especially for polynomials) for everything, even if the problem explicitly says to use a different basis, so watch out.

          <em>Instructor Notes:</em> §5.3 covers dot product over ℝn, and then §10.1 generalizes to general inner products. Note that this book does not list “&#x3C;v,v>=0 iff v=0” as one of the required inner product axioms; it states it as a consequence. They should be able to verify a function is/is not an inner product, though we’ll give them a specific property to prove/disprove. You should plan to go over the inner product &#x3C;p,q>=01p(x)q(x)dx (for polynomials) with them in class, and practice computing length and distance. They will try to use the dot product for everything.
        </p>

        <p>
          There should be room in the schedule to discuss additional inner products, such as &#x3C;A,B>=tr(ABT) for matrices, evaluation of polynomials, and defining an inner product in terms of a positive definite matrix (however, we did not cover the Chapter 8 in the book, so be sure to define positive definite here).
        </p>

        <p>
          The book states CBS Inequality with squares on everything, but I think it’s more useful in the unsquared form (using absolute value).
        </p>

        <p>
          They should be prepared to check orthogonality for non-standard inner products.
          They should be able to use an inner product to find coefficients, and be able to build an orthonormal basis from an orthogonal basis.
          Gram-Schmidt is on the homework, but not on the final, so I’d go over it quickly in class (note: our book doesn’t do projections until later).
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>TA Notes:</em> Please emphasize computing inner products, length, and distance using weird inner products does NOT give the same answer as the dot product. Vectors which are orthogonal with respect to the dot product may not be orthogonal with respect to another inner product.
